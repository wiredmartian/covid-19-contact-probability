# Covid-19 contact probability

This address a few questions:

  1. How careful do you need to be depending on where you are in the world.
  
  2. What is your probability of coming into contact with an infected person.
  
  3. And what is your probability as the days go by.
  
  
## Important note

The application is fined tune to South-African stats in terms of probability.

The rest of the countries that appear are considered in terms of covid-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and history.

This is unfortunately because I could not find a FREE API offering world census data.



## How to run

You need to have the vue-cli install in your machine
